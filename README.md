TagProGroupChatNotifier
=======================

Notifies you if your name is called in TagPro Group Chat.

To use this userscript, make sure Tampermonkey (or equivalent) is installed.
Then press the 'raw' button, which will take you to a Tampermonkey (or equivalent) page with a button to install.

Before you press install, look at the small bit of code after where you see // ==/UserScript==. In here you can edit some clearly labelled components. 

The most important is: requestTerm = "yourName";
which needs to be changed accordingly.

You can also then edit colours and other stuff, then finalise the install process by pressing the Install button!
