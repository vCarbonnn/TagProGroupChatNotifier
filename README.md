TagProGroupChatNotifier
=======================

Notifies you if your name is called in TagPro Group Chat.

To use this userscript, make sure Tampermonkey (or equivalent) is installed.
Then press the 'raw' button, which will take you to a Tampermonkey (or equivalent) page with a button to install.

There are a few options that you can change (one being the request name!), which can be easily edited within Tampermonkey. Go to the Tampermonkey dashboard (via the Tampermonkey button), find the TagPro Group Chat Notifier userscript and click it. In here are the clearly labelled components which can be edited by you. 

The most important is: requestTerm = "yourName";
which needs to be changed accordingly.

Make sure to save any changes using the second from left save button, not save to disk!
