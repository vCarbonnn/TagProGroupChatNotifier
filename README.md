TagProGroupChatNotifier
=======================

Notifies you if your name is called in TagPro Group Chat.

To use this userscript, make sure Tampermonkey (or equivalent) is installed.
Then press the 'raw' button, which will take you to a Tampermonkey (or equivalent) page with a button to install which you can press.

Now navigate to the Tampermonkey dashboard and select the userscript 'TagPro Group Chat Notifier'.

===

If you don't know how to do this, follow this:

\1. Press the icon in the top right of your browser (the one that looks like an upside down cassette) and press Dashboard: http://i.imgur.com/9An5bHZ.png

 \1a. If it doesn't, click the settings (those three lines), then go to Tools > More Tools > Extensions and make sure the checkbox next to enabled is checked

\2. Pick the 'TagPro Group Chat Notifier' userscript to edit it.

===

Now look at the small bit of code after where you see '// ==/UserScript=='. In here you can edit some clearly labelled components.
The most important is: requestTerm = "yourName";    which needs to be changed accordingly.


You can also then edit colours and other stuff, then finalise the install process by pressing the Install button!
